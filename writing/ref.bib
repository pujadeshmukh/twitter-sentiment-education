  abstract = {The challenge of the econometric problem in production efficiency
	analysis is that the efficiency scores to be analyzed are unobserved.
	Statistical properties have recently been discovered for a type of
	estimator popular in the literature, known as data envelopment analysis
	(DEA). This opens up a wide range of possibilities for well-grounded
	statistical inference about the true efficiency scores from their
	DEA estimates. In this paper we investigate the possibility of using
	existing tests for the equality of two distributions in such a context.
	Considering the statistical complications pertinent to our context,
	we consider several approaches to adapting the Li test to the context
	and explore their performance in terms of the size and power of the
	test in various Monte Carlo experiments. One of these approaches
	shows good performance for both the size and the power of the test,
	thus encouraging its use in empirical studies. We also present an
	empirical illustration analyzing the efficiency distributions of
	countries in the world, following up a recent study by Kumar and
	Russell (2002), and report very interesting results.},
